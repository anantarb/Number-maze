Consider a puzzle that consists of a n × n grid where each field contains a value xij ∈ N. Our player starts in the top left corner of the grid. Our goal is to reach the bottom right corner.

RULES OF THE GAME: On each turn, you may move your player up, down, left or right. The distance by which the player moves in a chosen direction is given by the number of its current cell. You must stay within the board (you cannot go off the edge of the board).

EXAMPLE: If your player is on a square with value 3, then you may move either three steps up, down, left or right (as long as you don’t leave the board).
